#### Assumptions - Notes

1. we assume that we have top one and only minimum or maximum path solution
1. The input data are following the guidelines definition
    * they are integers.
    * the triangle is always equilateral and there are no missing numbers or letters. 
1. Node class
    * On each node, we do not use children nor parent node.
1. triangleGraph class
    * [be_data_big](./be_data_big.txt) last row's should produce 2000 parents
    * [be_data_small](./be_data_small.txt) last row's should produce 50 parents
    * [data.sample](./data.sample.txt) last row's is producing 5 parents
    
#### Next Steps
1. Implement appropriate partitioning approach for big input files with more than 2000 lines
